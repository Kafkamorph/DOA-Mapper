Starting requirements:
=====================

A Firefox with Firebug
A Linux server with any HTTPD and php5, MySQL server.

After the key is extracted (see above), you can play on Chrome instead of Firefox (recommended).

- replace the realmxxx on the map.pyp file with your server's number.
- input your mysql's credentials.
- there are 2 tables used: one with the actual data, and another table that keeps the relation between a user's ID and his name. More on that below.
- run the game normally, with Firebug installed and opened.
- first of all, find your realm's number. You can do that by going to "change realm" and seeing the number of the server where you are.
