Realm 291 - Mesite people:

- Stella: Love you.
- finn: if you're an ass like that at 12 years old, let's all hope you don't reach 21. You're illiterate, ignorant, immature, and, basically, should pay tax for the air you breathe. Diagnosis: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.
- Foxx: a nice guy. ^5 bud.
- Brienne: top notch guy. I bow to you.
- MateosX: you made me laugh, and you're a hell of a player. Kudos to you.
- Blackout: cool sometimes, other times looks like finn. Diagnosis: 
- Elv: i could say i like you, but as that text that never arrived (let's face it, you never sent it) it was a big disappointment.
- Shi: Woody once, Woody forever! Big hugs.
- INDRIT: you were not so bad after all. Cheers.
- Gypsy: finally you have a map that doesn't fail. Cheers.
- EBLM: can be cool sometimes, but, as it was proven before with Mar, rubies can't buy respect. One day he's Robin Hood, next day he's a bully. Diagnosis: Antisocial personality disorder.
- Alice: please marry EBLM. So that only 1 home is ruined. If not, just make sure he keeps sending pics of his dick on the interwebs. That will surely make you happy. *snicker* Diagnosis: Narcissistic personality disorder.
- Thebie and Xysticus: thanks for all the heads up and tips in my start. Respect.
- Espa√±oles: you're all nabs. Learn some english, and since you're at it, learn to play.

- Rogue: where da frakk are you?
