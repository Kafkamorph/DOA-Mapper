Realm 291 - Mesite people:

- Stella: Love you <3. Nuff said.

- finn: if you're an ass like that at 12 years old, let's all hope you don't reach 21. 
    You're illiterate, ignorant, immature, and, basically, should pay tax for the air you breathe. 
    Diagnosis: Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder + immaturity + illiteracy.

- Foxx: a nice guy. ^5 bud.

- Brienne: top notch guy. I bow to thee.

- MateosX: you made me laugh, and you're a hell of a player. Kudos to you.

- Blackout: cool sometimes, other times looks like finn. Diagnosis: bipolar disordery.

- Elv: i could say i like you, but as that text that never arrived (let's face it, you never sent it) 
    was a big disappointment. Diagnosis: Compulsive liar, or a persona/alt of someone 
    just to show off some hot (although some not so hot) pictures.

- Shimara and Ophelia: Woody once, Woody forever! Big hugs.

- Zanthura. hated by some, never made me any bad. Intelligent remarks, i can only say good. Cheers.

- INDRIT: sometimes, you are cool, the others, you're a retard. But you do have the temper of a woman - unstable. 
    Diagnosis: possible homosexual.

- Gypsy: finally you have a map that doesn't fail. Awesome player. Cheers.

- EBLM: can be cool sometimes, but, as it was proven before with Mar, rubies can't buy respect, and everyone 
    says he's a ruby buyer. (/I/ have no proof, though, but the excess of speedups just seems "too much").
  One day he's Robin Hood, next day he's a bully. Diagnosis: Antisocial personality disorder.

- NumQuamRetro: the original guy who played this account was cool, and told me "i taught EBLM everything he knows",
    but now he's being played by someone else, who is a bit of an asshole.

- Alice: You started cool, but it was only showoff. Typical teenager. Please marry EBLM. So that only 1 home is ruined. 
    If not, just make sure he keeps sending pics of his dick on the interwebs. 
    That will surely make you happy. *snicker* Diagnosis: Narcissistic personality disorder + Grandiose delusions.

- Thebie and Xysticus: thanks for all the heads up and tips in my start. Respect.

- EspaÃ±oles: you're all nabs. Learn some english, and since you're at it, learn to play. 
    Diego, you can be barely called a human. You're just a dumbass parasite and everyone makes fun on you.

- Zanthura: tries to be nice to everybody, but does not achieve it everytime and is a backstabber too.
    Diagnosis: bipolar disorder.

- Allaerra: Polite, nice to talk to, gives credit where credit is due. Cheers. A rarity. 
    Diagnosis: every MMO needs more people like Allaerra.

- Hell Boy 8: just talks too much, but quite harmless. Consider him a realm pet.

- Rogue: where da frakk were you? At least say you'll be busy, even Black and Finn saying they scared you off.
    Some dumbasses said (finn and Black, obviously) you and I were the same person - the morons who don't know I 
    already have 3 acccounts (7.7M, 5.7M, 3.1M) in Mesite.
