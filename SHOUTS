Realm 291 - Mesite people:

- Stella: Love you.
- finn: if you're an ass like that at 12 years old, let's all hope you don't reach 21.
- Foxx: ^5 bud.
- Brienne: top notch guy. I bow to you.
- MateosX: you made me laugh, and you're a hell of a player. Kudos to you.
- Blackout: mostly the same as finn, expect with a different age. 
- Elv: i could say i like you, but that text that never arrived (let's face it, it was never sent) was a disappointment.
- Shi: Woody once, Woody forever! Big hugs.
- INDRIT: you were not so bad after all. Cheers.
- Gypsy: finally you have a map that doesn't fail. Cheers.
- EBLM: as it was proven before with Mar, rubies can't buy respect.
- Alice: please marry EBLM. So that only 1 home is ruined. If not, just make sure he keeps sending pics of his dick on the interwebs. That will surely make you happy. Not.
- Thebie and Xysticus: thanks for all the heads up and tips in my start. Respect.
- Rogue: where da frakk are you?
