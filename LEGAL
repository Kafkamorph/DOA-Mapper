FACT - I have contacted Kabam 2 months ago, warning them about the vulnerability, and the ability of any player to do a full map scan.
FACT - They never replied.
FACT - On the forums, I posted the vuln, and they banned my account, with the inaccurate excuse of "encouraging players to break TOS, threatening forum staff"
FACT - They banned 4 forum accountsi had. I have more than 100, but i decided not to pursue the subject on the forums.
FACT - I offered my services as Network Security Auditor to help them fix the problem. They haven't replied.
FACT - It is a known fact that, when a vul is discovered, the "victim" should be warned, and then has a time limit to fix it, or it will go public.
FACT - It is still not fixed. They do not care about protecting players' ingame data.
FACT - For those geeks who know what it means, i'm not a blackhat. I'm trying to be whitehat since 1992 (YES, before I was 100& blackhat), but Kabam 
    insulted me, with their actions, so, in the end, some might say my actions were "greyhat". But believe me, just whitehatting. 
    They didn't answer, they paid for it. That's how it works in the security network kingdom.

FACT - I talked to my company's lawyer, and I have absolute assurance that, IF they are stupid enough to try anything against me, it is I who will
subpoena them. Basically, to make a long conversation with my lawyer short, they are breaking their own TOS, and neglecting the safety of all
players who ever bought rubies. That's like doing illegal, proven, actions, to thousands of players.

FACT - If aforementioned players feel Kabam failed them, they ARE entitled to ask for a refund.
