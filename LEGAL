FACT - I have contacted Kabam 2 months ago, warning them about the vulnerability, and the ability of any player to do a full map scan.
FACT - They never replied.
FACT - On the forums, I posted the vuln, and they banned my account, with the inaccurate excuse of "encouraging players to break TOS, threatening forum staff"
FACT - They banned 4 forum accountsi had. I have more than 100, but i decided not to pursue the subject on the forums.
FACT - I offered my services as Network Security Auditor to help them fix the problem. They haven't replied.
FACT - It is a known fact that, when a vul is discovered, the "victim" should be warned, and then has a time limit to fix it, or it will go public.
FACT - It is still not fixed. They do not care about protecting players' ingame data.

FACT - I talked to my company's lawyer, and I have absolute assurance that, IF they are stupid enough to try anything against me, it is I who will
subpoena them. Basically, to make a long conversation with my lawyer short, they are breaking their own TOS, and neglecting the safety of all
players who ever bough rubies.

FACT - If aforementioned players feel Kabam failed them, they ARE entitled to ask for a refund.
