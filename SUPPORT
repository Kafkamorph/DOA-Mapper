You can contact me on the GitHub project page, and I will:

- NOT respond to "how do i install Linux or apache" and noob questions like that. You're on your own.
- try to help with FireBug and getting the values needed for the script to work.
- NOT take care of your database maintenance, crontabs or other things like that. If you're not at that level, give it up.

Also, i'm open to requests of "don't map my realm", and "do a complete map of my realm just for me".
Doesn't mean all of these will be for free, though.
