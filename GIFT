As a gift, i'm including the latest realm (Cantil) data in .sql - cantil.sql and cantilnomes.sql 

Since the first run takes some time to extract the player names according to their ID, I already made all that work for you.
Import them to your sql database named 'doa' then run the map.php to update it.  (after following everything in the TECH file)

Edit your Crontab to run it every 6 hours or so.

OR

Just go to http://doamapper.m3ta.info - that's a second gift. A full mapping of Cantil realm.
