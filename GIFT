As a gift, i'm including the latest realm (Cantil) data in .sql.
Sicne the first run takes some time to extract the player names according to their ID, I already made that work for you.

Import them to your sql them modify he map.php to update it.

OR


Just go to http://map.m3ta.info - that's a second gift. Still mapping Cantil, but it will finish soon.
